# PART VI — PSYCHOLOGY, IDENTITY & ACCOUNTABILITY

## 27. Cognitive Biases & Emotional Management

Biases like confirmation and recency blind traders. Emotions kill more accounts than bad strategies.

Common: Anchoring (sticking to old prices), overconfidence (after wins), recency (overweighting recent events).

Strategies: Mindfulness (deep breathing), pause 5 minutes before trades. Example: Log bias triggers weekly.

## 28. Trading Identity Shift: Student → Operator

Shift mindset: From gambler to professional. Identity drives behavior.

Transformation: Daily affirmations ("I am disciplined"), visualize success. Example: Role-play as a fund manager.

## 29. Account Growth & Overconfidence Cycles

Growth: Compound patiently. 10% monthly is sustainable.

Cycles: Avoid euphoria after wins (leads to over-leveraging); humility after losses. Example: Win streak? Reduce size.

## 30. Crisis Recovery Protocol

Losses happen; recover systematically. Drawdowns are tests.

Steps: Assess (what went wrong?), rest (take a break), analyze (journal), return smaller (micro lots).

## 31. Discipline Rituals (Focus, Fasting, Meditation)

Rituals build resilience. Consistency creates habits.

Focus: Pomodoro (25-min work blocks).

Fasting: Mental clarity (intermittent fasting).

Meditation: Emotional control (10-min daily).

## 32. Self-Sabotage Detection System

Detect: Impulsive trades, revenge trading. Sabotage is internal enemy.

System: Triggers (e.g., boredom), logs, interventions (walk away). Example: 3 losses in a row? Stop trading.

Master mind over market. Psychology is 80% of trading.
