# PART II — FOREX STRUCTURE, PARTICIPANTS & PLATFORMS

## 4. Forex Market Structure & Participants

Forex isn't a single exchange like stocks—it's a decentralized network of buyers and sellers. Understanding its structure is key to anticipating liquidity and volatility. Without this, you're trading blind; with it, you navigate like a pro.

### Interbank System
At the core is the interbank market: banks trading directly via electronic platforms like Reuters or Bloomberg terminals. Major banks (e.g., JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup) form the backbone, quoting prices and providing liquidity. They handle 90% of volume, with spreads as tight as 0.1 pips.

Retail traders access this through brokers, but spreads widen during thin liquidity (e.g., weekends, when interbank closes). For example, EUR/USD might spread from 0.1 pips mid-week to 2–3 pips on Sunday.

### Liquidity Providers, Brokers, ECNs
- **Liquidity Providers**: Banks and institutions supply quotes. They profit from spreads and ensure market depth. Without them, markets would freeze.
- **Brokers**: Intermediaries connecting retail traders to interbank. Types: Dealing Desk (DD) acts as counterparty, profiting from retail losses; Non-Dealing Desk (NDD) passes orders to interbank.
- **ECNs (Electronic Communication Networks)**: Platforms like Currenex or LMAX allow direct trading, with tighter spreads but higher commissions. Ideal for transparency.

Brokers earn via spreads (DD) or commissions (ECN). Choose wisely—poor brokers cause slippage.

### Major/Minor/Exotic Pairs
- **Majors**: High-volume pairs like EUR/USD (80% of trades), GBP/USD, USD/JPY. Low spreads (0.1–0.5 pips), high liquidity. Example: EUR/USD moves 100–200 pips daily.
- **Minors**: Crosses without USD, e.g., EUR/GBP, AUD/NZD. Moderate liquidity, spreads 1–2 pips. Good for diversification.
- **Exotics**: Emerging currencies like USD/TRY, USD/ZAR. High volatility (500+ pips daily), wide spreads (5–10 pips)—risky for beginners due to news sensitivity.

Start with majors for stability; exotics for thrill (and potential losses).

### Session Characteristics
Forex operates 24/5, across four main sessions:
- **Tokyo (00:00–09:00 GMT)**: Yen pairs volatile; Asian data (e.g., BOJ decisions) drives moves. USD/JPY often gaps.
- **London (08:00–17:00 GMT)**: Most active (40% of volume); EUR/GBP surges. Overlaps Tokyo end.
- **New York (13:30–22:00 GMT)**: USD pairs peak; NFP data causes spikes. Overlaps London for high volume.
- **Sydney (22:00–07:00 GMT)**: Pre-Tokyo; AUD/NZD active. Low volume but sets tone.

Volatility spikes at overlaps (e.g., London-New York, 13:30–17:00 GMT). Low liquidity on weekends causes gaps—avoid trading then.

For Chartcraft, sessions dictate when to trade: London for EUR, New York for USD.

## 5. Brokers, Platforms & Setup

Choosing the right broker and platform is foundational. Poor setup leads to slippage, high costs, and frustration. Think of it as building a house—weak foundation, everything collapses.

### Market Maker vs ECN
- **Market Maker**: Broker acts as counterparty, profiting from retail losses. Wider spreads (1–2 pips), potential conflicts (e.g., stop hunts to trigger losses). Suitable for beginners but less transparent. Example: Broker buys at 1.1000, sells to you at 1.1002.
- **ECN**: Direct access to interbank. Tighter spreads (0.1–0.5 pips), commissions (e.g., $5/lot). Ideal for pros; requires discipline. No conflicts, but you pay fees.

Regulate brokers via FCA (UK), ASIC (Australia), or CFTC (US). Avoid offshore (e.g., unregulated Seychelles brokers) with poor oversight—check via BrokerCheck.

### MT5, TradingView, and MyFXBook
- **MT5**: Advanced platform for charting, backtesting, and automation. Supports multiple assets; use for SMC analysis. Free with brokers; add indicators like OB scripts.
- **TradingView**: Web-based charting with social features. Free tier for basics; premium ($15/month) for indicators. Excellent for replay and community insights. Example: Replay EUR/USD NFP reaction.
- **MyFXBook**: Track performance, copy trades, and analyze portfolios. Use for journaling and edge validation. Free basic; premium for advanced stats.

### Account Creation & Backtesting Setup
1. Choose broker (e.g., IC Markets for ECN—low spreads, MT5 support).
2. Open demo account—practice without risk. Fund with virtual $100,000.
3. Set up MT5/TradingView: Import indicators (e.g., OB markers from scripts). Customize charts (candles, Fibs).
4. Backtest: Use historical data; replay trades to refine strategies. Example: Backtest OB entries on GBP/USD.
5. Fund live account minimally (e.g., $100) for real execution. Start micro lots (0.01).

Ensure low latency (VPS for remote trading, $10/month) and secure connections (2FA, VPN).
