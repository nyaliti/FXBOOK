# PART V — RESEARCH, TRACKING & IMPROVEMENT

## 21. Trade Journaling & Performance Metrics

Journaling turns experience into wisdom. Without it, you're guessing; with it, you're learning.

Journal setup: Date, pair, setup, entry/exit, P&L, notes. Include screenshots, emotions, lessons.

Metrics: Win rate (wins/total trades), RR ratio (avg win/avg loss), drawdown (peak-to-trough loss).

## 22. Backtesting, Replay & Edge Validation

Backtest strategies on historical data. Test before risking real money.

Replay: Watch price action unfold in TradingView.

Validate: Ensure >50% win rate with 1:2 RR. Example: 60% wins, 1:1.5 RR = positive expectancy.

## 23. Fundamental Drivers & News Mastery

Fundamentals drive trends. Ignore at your peril.

Key drivers: GDP (growth), inflation (prices), employment (jobs).

News: Trade around events (e.g., pre-NFP scalp); avoid spikes (high volatility).
