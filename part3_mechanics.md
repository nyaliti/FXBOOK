# PART III — PRICE MECHANICS & MARKET STRUCTURE

## 6. Core Price Mechanics

Price action is the heartbeat of forex. Understanding its phases reveals market intent, separating impulsive moves from corrections. Without this, charts are noise; with it, they're stories of power.

### Impulsive, Corrective, Consolidation Phases
- **Impulsive Phase**: Strong, directional moves with minimal retracements (<10%). Indicates strong momentum (e.g., breakouts after accumulation). Example: EUR/USD surging 100 pips without pullback.
- **Corrective Phase**: Retracements against the trend (20–50%). Shallow corrections (23.6% Fib) signal continuation; deep ones (61.8%) warn of reversals. Example: After bullish impulse, 38.2% dip resumes uptrend.
- **Consolidation Phase**: Sideways movement (range-bound), building energy for the next impulse. Often precedes big moves, like triangles. Example: Price oscillating 50 pips before breakout.

In SMC, impulses are "smart money" accumulation (institutions buying/selling); corrections are retail traps (stops triggered).

### RBR, DBD, Accumulation → Manipulation → Expansion
- **RBR (Range Before Break)**: Price ranges before breaking out, testing liquidity. Example: EUR/USD in 1.0500–1.0600 range for weeks.
- **DBD (Double Bottom/Double Top)**: Reversal patterns signaling shifts. Double bottom bullish; double top bearish.
- **Accumulation**: Institutions build positions quietly in ranges, absorbing retail orders.
- **Manipulation**: Price lured to liquidity zones (stops) for sweeps, creating FVG imbalances.
- **Expansion**: Explosive moves after traps, as institutions push price.

These mechanics show markets as orchestrated events, not random. Example: Pre-NFP, price manipulates to stops, then expands on data.

## 7. Market Structure Theory

Structure defines trends and reversals. Mastering it turns charts into roadmaps. Structure is the skeleton; price action the flesh.

### HH, HL, LH, LL Logic
- **HH (Higher High)**: Bullish; each peak higher than previous. Example: EUR/USD highs at 1.1000, 1.1100, 1.1200.
- **HL (Higher Low)**: Bullish; each trough higher. Confirms uptrend.
- **LH (Lower High)**: Bearish; peaks declining. Example: GBP/USD highs at 1.3000, 1.2900, 1.2800.
- **LL (Lower Low)**: Bearish; troughs declining. Confirms downtrend.

Breaks of HL/LL signal BOS (Break of Structure)—trend shifts.

### BOS vs CHoCH
- **BOS**: Trend continuation; price breaks recent swing high/low. Example: Bullish BOS above previous high.
- **CHoCH (Change of Character)**: Reversal; momentum shifts (e.g., from bullish to bearish). Marked by equal highs/lows or momentum divergence.

### Internal vs External Structure
- **Internal**: Within trend; smaller swings (e.g., M15). Used for entries.
- **External**: Major levels (e.g., H4); breaks indicate new trends. Example: Breaking H4 LL starts downtrend.

### Multi-Timeframe Context
Analyze H4 for direction (bias), H1 for entries, M15 for precision. Higher timeframes override lower ones. Example: H4 bullish? Look for H1 BOS.

## 8. Liquidity Theory

Liquidity is where institutions hunt. Understanding it predicts traps and sweeps. Liquidity is the battlefield; know it to survive.

### External/Internal Liquidity
- **External**: Above/below structure (e.g., old highs/lows). Institutions place stops here for hunts. Example: Stops above recent high.
- **Internal**: Within range; retail orders cluster. Swept for manipulation.

### Stop Hunts, Sweeps, and Liquidity Pools
- **Stop Hunts**: Price spikes to trigger stops, then reverses. Example: Pre-news, price hits stops, drops back.
- **Sweeps**: Quick touches of levels to grab liquidity. Example: Wick to S/R without close.
- **Pools**: Areas of concentrated orders; trade towards them for fills. Example: OB areas.

Map liquidity on charts: Look for imbalances (FVGs). Example: Liquidity above resistance for shorts.

## 9. Smart Money Concepts (SMC)

SMC decodes institutional behavior. It's the core of Chartcraft. SMC is reading the market's mind—anticipating big players.

### Order Blocks (Valid, Invalid, Mitigation, Breaker)
- **Valid OB**: Unmitigated, high-probability. Price hasn't re-entered. Example: OB at impulse start, untouched.
- **Invalid**: Mitigated by price re-entry. Low probability.
- **Mitigation**: Price re-enters OB, reducing validity. Partial fill.
- **Breaker**: OB breaks structure, invalidating old levels.

Mark OBs at impulse starts (e.g., after BOS). Example: Bullish OB at swing low.

### Fair Value Gaps (Imbalance Marking)
FVGs are unfilled price areas (gaps between candles). Price fills them via reversals or continuations. Example: Three-candle gap; price returns to fill.

### Institutional Stacking and OB–FVG Confluence
Stack OBs with FVGs for high-conviction setups. E.g., OB near FVG in liquidity zone. Example: OB at FVG fill for entry.

## 10. Supply, Demand, and SnR

Levels define battles. Master them for edges. S&R is the market's memory—past levels influence future.

### Institutional vs Retail S&R
- **Institutional**: Major zones (e.g., round numbers, psych levels); hold longer. Example: 1.0000 on EUR/USD.
- **Retail**: Minor levels (e.g., 1.0525); easily broken by news.

### SnR Flips, Polarity & Ranking
- **Flips**: Support becomes resistance (and vice versa). Example: Broken support turns resistance.
- **Polarity**: Context-dependent (bullish/bearish). Example: 1.0500 support in uptrend, resistance in downtrend.
- **Ranking**: Prioritize based on touches/tests. Example: Level tested 5 times ranks higher.

## 11. Fibonacci Precision

Fib enhances SMC with ratios. Fib is the math of nature—applied to markets.

### Retracement & Extension Levels in SMC Context
Use 0.618 retracements for corrections; extensions (1.618) for targets. Example: After impulse, 61.8% retracement for entry.

### Fib + OB + FVG Confluence
Combine for precision: Entry at Fib level near OB/FVG. Example: 78.6% Fib confluence with OB for long.
