# PART III — PRICE MECHANICS & MARKET STRUCTURE

## 6. Core Price Mechanics

Price action is the heartbeat of forex. Understanding its phases reveals market intent, separating impulsive moves from corrections.

### Impulsive, Corrective, Consolidation Phases
- **Impulsive Phase**: Strong, directional moves with minimal retracements. Indicates strong momentum (e.g., breakouts).
- **Corrective Phase**: Retracements against the trend. Shallow corrections signal continuation; deep ones warn of reversals.
- **Consolidation Phase**: Sideways movement, building energy for the next impulse. Often precedes big moves.

In SMC, impulses are "smart money" accumulation; corrections are retail traps.

### RBR, DBD, Accumulation → Manipulation → Expansion
- **RBR (Range Before Break)**: Price ranges before breaking out.
- **DBD (Double Bottom/Double Top)**: Reversal patterns signaling shifts.
- **Accumulation**: Institutions build positions quietly.
- **Manipulation**: Price lured to liquidity zones for stops.
- **Expansion**: Explosive moves after traps.

These mechanics show markets as orchestrated events, not random.

## 7. Market Structure Theory

Structure defines trends and reversals. Mastering it turns charts into roadmaps.

### HH, HL, LH, LL Logic
- **HH (Higher High)**: Bullish; each peak higher than previous.
- **HL (Higher Low)**: Bullish; each trough higher.
- **LH (Lower High)**: Bearish; peaks declining.
- **LL (Lower Low)**: Bearish; troughs declining.

Breaks of HL/LL signal BOS (Break of Structure).

### BOS vs CHoCH
- **BOS**: Trend continuation; price breaks recent swing.
- **CHoCH (Change of Character)**: Reversal; momentum shifts (e.g., from bullish to bearish).

### Internal vs External Structure
- **Internal**: Within trend; smaller swings.
- **External**: Major levels; breaks indicate new trends.

### Multi-Timeframe Context
Analyze H4 for direction, H1 for entries, M15 for precision. Higher timeframes override lower ones.

## 8. Liquidity Theory

Liquidity is where institutions hunt. Understanding it predicts traps and sweeps.

### External/Internal Liquidity
- **External**: Above/below structure (e.g., old highs/lows). Institutions place stops here.
- **Internal**: Within range; retail orders cluster.

### Stop Hunts, Sweeps, and Liquidity Pools
- **Stop Hunts**: Price spikes to trigger stops, then reverses.
- **Sweeps**: Quick touches of levels to grab liquidity.
- **Pools**: Areas of concentrated orders; trade towards them for fills.

Map liquidity on charts: Look for imbalances.

## 9. Smart Money Concepts (SMC)

SMC decodes institutional behavior. It's the core of Chartcraft.

### Order Blocks (Valid, Invalid, Mitigation, Breaker)
- **Valid OB**: Unmitigated, high-probability.
- **Invalid**: Mitigated by price.
- **Mitigation**: Price re-enters OB, reducing validity.
- **Breaker**: OB breaks structure.

Mark OBs at impulse starts.

### Fair Value Gaps (Imbalance Marking)
FVGs are unfilled price areas. Price fills them via reversals or continuations.

### Institutional Stacking and OB–FVG Confluence
Stack OBs with FVGs for high-conviction setups. E.g., OB near FVG in liquidity.

## 10. Supply, Demand, and SnR

Levels define battles. Master them for edges.

### Institutional vs Retail S&R
- **Institutional**: Major zones; hold longer.
- **Retail**: Minor levels; easily broken.

### SnR Flips, Polarity & Ranking
- **Flips**: Support becomes resistance (and vice versa).
- **Polarity**: Context-dependent (bullish/bearish).
- **Ranking**: Prioritize based on touches/tests.

## 11. Fibonacci Precision

Fib enhances SMC with ratios.

### Retracement & Extension Levels in SMC Context
Use 0.618 retracements for corrections; extensions (1.618) for targets.

### Fib + OB + FVG Confluence
Combine for precision: Entry at Fib level near OB/FVG.
